# Flareup

Growing up along the Marcellus Shale in the Northeastern US, Iâ€™ve long had a relationship of horror/fascination with fracking and fossil gas. Living in Europe for the first time this semester, I found my life unexpectedly similar being 6,600 km away. My research on gas infrastructure showed an unexpected link: massive quantities of fossil gas fracked across the US being shipped across the ocean from Marcellus all the way to the EU, helping power my life here in Berlin, at enormous cost to poorer American communities and the climate at large. Flareup explores this story through an interactive animated website.

Originally from central Pennsylvania, they started coding at an early age, working on open source and teaching coding through hackathons before taking them to the climate tech community in San Francisco. At NYU, they major in interactive media arts, making art to shine light on the climate emergency through interactive experiences.
