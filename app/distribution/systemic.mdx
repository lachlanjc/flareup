Fossil gas was promoted to America under two premises: it’s cleaner than coal, and it would free America from dependence on foreign oil. Both were **red herrings**.

In 2015, days after the Paris agreement to limit emissions, Congressional Democrats lifted a forty-year-long ban on exporting oil & gas. The next year, the first terminal began exporting fossil gas from the U.S. Seven terminals now operate, with dozens more planned. The U.S. has surpassed Russia and Qatar to become the largest exporter of gas in the world.

What’s the process of exporting gas? After the gas is fracked, it enters pipelines crisscrossing the country; some leaks out during that process. It’s then loaded onto huge tanker ships at **export terminals**, which burn yet more fossil fuels to transport the fuel.

{/* The first large-scale L.N.G. exports began in 2016; Vladimir Putin provided a rationale for backing increased exports when he launched his attack on Ukraine in 2022 and turned down the gas tap for Europe. The U.S. and others met the challenge, exporting fifty-six billion cubic metres to the European Union last year; the Biden Administration has promised another fifty billion this winter. Projects like C.P.2, though, won’t be done for at least three years, by which time the geopolitical reasoning will presumably have faded, but the infrastructure will linger for decades. The U.S. has now surpassed Russia and Qatar to become the single largest exporter of L.N.G. in the world. */}
