Where is all this gas going? Two thirds goes to Europe, and most of the rest to Asia. Five countries—the Netherlands, the U.K., France, Spain, and Germany—imported more than half of U.S. gas exports this year.

Cut off from cheap Russian gas during the Ukraine war and lacking its own reserves, the E.U. is busy building new import terminals to receive American gas.

Yet the E.U. is simultaneously trying to reduce its emissions, including by phasing out coal and gas.

U.S. gas companies are hoping to keep exporting gas far past U.S. and E.U. fossil fuel phaseouts, to new markets in Asia. If the proposed export terminals are all built, they will be associated with an extra 3.2 billion tons of greenhouse-gas emissions annually—comparable to the emissions of the entire E.U.
