Where is all this exported gas going? Two-thirds goes to Europe, and most of the rest to Asia. Five countries—the Netherlands, the U.K., France, Spain, and Germany—imported over half of American gas exports this year.

Cut off from cheap Russian gas during the Ukraine war and lacking its own reserves, the E.U. is busy building new import terminals to receive American gas. This is despite the fact the E.U. is trying to reduce its emissions, and has reduced gas usage by 18% in the last year.

U.S. gas companies are hoping to keep fracking for export long after the U.S. and E.U. have phased out fossil fuels. Right now, the Ukraine conflict offers a marketable political case that these new terminals are necessary, though they won’t open for years. New customers can, they hope, be found elsewhere, especially in Asia.
