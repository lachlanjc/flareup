Much of our energy comes from fossil gas (“natural gas”). It’s a fossil fuel, like coal or oil, powering stoves, boilers, water heating. It also provides electricity—`30-50%` in Berlin and NYC, respectively.

Most fossil gas is extracted through fracking: a relatively new, incredibly toxic process that became widespread in the U.S. in the 2000s. State College is deeply linked to, and surrounded by, the fracking boom.

Pennsylvania now has over `200,000` oil & gas wells, making it the second largest producer of gas in the country. The nearest active fracking to my house is `15 miles` / `25 km` away. No one told me about that.

State College remains insulated from the pollution that poorer, more rural areas surrounding us continue to live on the front lines of. My town made hundreds of millions from the profits of fracking other people’s land.

This is the story of how that very gas is now powering our lives here in Europe.

{/* For college, I moved to New York City, where nearly half of energy is gas-powered. There’s an `8,600 mile` / `14,000 km` pipeline system moving gas from the Gulf of Mexico to NYC, passing through State College. */}

{/* Fast forward to now, where I find myself studying abroad in Berlin. */}
