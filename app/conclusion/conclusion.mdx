Or, we could stop. This entire industry of exporting America’s gas is brand new, rapidly expanding, super polluting, and wildly stupid.

As the U.S. reduces domestic emissions, exporting gas is how American petrocorporations can continue to profit. While they ship our fuels elsewhere, the resulting emissions raise temperatures everywhere. In the meantime, they raise fuel and food prices for Americans, and the profits go to a few gas billionaires, while concentrating the wreckage in the poorest communities.

Exporting gas is a choice for America, one that is recent and reversible. Every new terminal needs an export license, and Biden’s administration can stop anytime. Congress can reinstitute the ban, and it should.
