Or, we could not. This entire industry of exporting America’s gas is brand new, rapidly expanding, super polluting, and wildly stupid.

You’ll hear propaganda regularly about how “natural” gas is a “cleaner” or “bridge” fuel—including from Democrats. Burning it emits less pollution than coal; but new research shows that including the impact of shipping it, fossil gas contributes `2.5x` more climate pollution than coal.

As the U.S. reduces its own emissions, exporting gas is how American petrocorporations can continue profiting. While they ship our fuels elsewhere, the resulting emissions raise temperatures everywhere. In the meantime, they raise fuel and food prices for Americans, and the profits go to a few gas companies, while polluting the poorest communities.

Exporting gas is a choice for America, one that is recent and reversible. Every new terminal needs an export license, and Biden’s administration can stop anytime. Congress can reinstitute the ban. The only people benefiting from this run petrocorporations.

We can profit instead off exporting clean electric infrastructure.
