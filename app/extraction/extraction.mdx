Fracking is the process of drilling into the ground, pumping pressurized toxic chemicals down to explode rock formations underground, releasing fossil gas and bringing it back to the surface.

It requires an enormous amount of water, and produces noise, air, light, and water pollution, and causes earthquakes. Rural landowners get paid a small fraction of the royalties.
