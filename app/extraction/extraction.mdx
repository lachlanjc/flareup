Fracking is the process of drilling into the ground; pumping pressurized toxic chemicals down to explode rock formations underground; releasing fossil gas; and bringing it back to the surface.

It requires an enormous amount of water; produces noise, air, light, and water pollution; and causes earthquakes. Rural landowners are paid a small fraction of the royalties.
